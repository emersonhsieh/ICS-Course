Solutions to Chris Pines' [Learn to Program in Ruby](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram).

In both Winter 2017 and Summer 2018, I was an undergraduate student instructor of UC Berkeley's *E98 Introduction to Computer Science in Ruby Bootcamp*. In the course, students completed exercises from Chris Pines' book. This repository contains my own solutions to the book's problems when I took the course in August 2017.
